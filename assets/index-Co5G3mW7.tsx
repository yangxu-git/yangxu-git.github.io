                     subSectionText="We introduce an innovative computational framework that integrates extensive data on human mobility, social network ties, and socioeconomic status to significantly advance our understanding of social segregation in urban environments. This framework moves beyond the traditional concept of residential segregation by offering granular measurements at the individual level. It captures segregation not only within the physical realm but also within the dimensions of social networks. Additionally, it facilitates aggregated assessments at the level of specific locales and entire cities, while also tracking their temporal evolution. This multifaceted approach provides a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the patterns and dynamics of urban social segregation."

                     subSectionText="Public open spaces (POS) are crucial public health assets meant for everyone, contributing to physical, social, and psychological well-being. With urban populations diversifying, assessing the spatial justice of Public Open Spaces in Private Developments (POSPDs) to ensure equitable access is crucial. This research evaluated three Hong Kong POSPDs through questionnaire surveys and Bayesian Network modeling. Findings highlighted the most sensitive issues (e.g., safety, affordability, and diversity) impacting spatial justice performance, emphasizing that inclusive POS requires a secure, affordable environment that supports diverse activity for everyone. The findings will guide decision-makers to put the appropriate emphasis on creating inclusive POSPD."
